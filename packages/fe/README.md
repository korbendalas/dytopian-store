## Project setup




## Icons
We use lucide icons for this project. You can find the icons here: https://lucide.dev/icons

Whatever icon you want to use, re-export them from `@/components/icons`
And use them like this:

```import { Icons } from '@/components/icons';
 <Icons.sun className="rotate-0 scale-100 transition-all dark:-rotate-90 dark:scale-0" />
```
